# Advanced Android Weather App using MVVM Architecture Sample (ViewModel + LiveData + Kotlin + volley) = Weather App

## Introduction
> - MVVM Architecture is one of the most popular and latest architecture to develop a maintanable and managable codebase.
> - Advanced WyyK Weather App is an Android App build with MVVM Architecture using Kotlin language and Volley network calling library.
> - The app shows your current location, and a list of cities showing current temperature of the city. (I used a total of 20 cities to display on the recycler view).
> - When a city is clicked, it will direct user to deatailed fragment whereby user will be able to see the current weather state 
> (Shown in the screenshots below) of the city and forecast of the next 6 days. User can add city to his/her favorite lists.
> - To add a city to favorite list, User will have to create an account so that data will not be lost if app is uninstalled or data is cleared.

## Run the project
> - Sync the Gradle and run the project. Install APK on your emulator or real device.
> - Turn on the internet of your testing device. For better understanding, please read the comments of every methods.
> - Hope, these comments will help you to feel the MVVM Architecture.

## Disclaimer
> - There are some other ways of implementation of MVVM.
> - We find most of the MVVM tutorials are covered with Rx and Dagger. But it's not mandatory to use Rx or Dagger in MVVM. 
> - The main difference between MVP and MVVM is: Presenter is not Life Cycle aware. On the otherhand ViewModel is Life Cycle aware.
